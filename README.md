# HideGoXLRWindow
 
## NOTE: AS OF VERSION 1.3.3.130+ this is now built-in functionality (see #4)

This little solution hides the GoXLR App window on startup since there is no way to do that from the software itself.

## How To Install
Just pull down the `HideGoXLR.ps1`, `HideGoXLR_startup.cmd`, `HideGoXLR_startup.vbs` and `install.bat` files and run the install. You can inspect anything in there, no funny stuff is going on.

The only thing that will happen is it will trigger a little PowerShell script (thanks to [@avodovnik](https://github.com/avodovnik)) that tries to find any GoXLR windows and closes them on startup. üëè
With the install file it moves the files in the right folders to line it up for startup, only for the current user.

The script will try 3 times, with 10 second intervals. If you find that the timing is off, fiddle a little with the param values in the ps1 file. Unfortunately, because of those timing issues it's best to let it actually run those 3*10 minutes.

### Logging
In case anything seems off, you can find a log at `%TEMP%\StartupLog.txt` which holds the output of the startup command

### The solution to "execution of scripts is disabled on this system"
If the script doesn't seem to run, inspect the log from above. Changes are you might find a message like "execution of scripts is disabled on this system".

In that case run this command in a PowerShel terminal

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

This will allow scripts to run for the current user. **Note:** make sure you understand what this does and what the (security) implications are. More information in the [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7).
